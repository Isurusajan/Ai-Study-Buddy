# Battle Mode Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed ✅

The BattleArena component was stuck on "Waiting for room connection..." because:

- It wasn't automatically creating a battle room when a deckId was passed
- The createBattle function was defined after it was being called

**Solution:** Restructured the component to auto-create battle when deckId is provided in URL.

## How to Test Now

### Step 1: Make Sure Servers Are Running

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\ACER\Documents\GitHub\Ai Study Buddy\server"
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\ACER\Documents\GitHub\Ai Study Buddy\client"
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Battle Creation

1. **Go to Dashboard**

   - Login to your account
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

2. **Click Battle Button**

   - On any study deck, click the purple "🎮 Battle" button
   - You should see:
     ```
     ✅ Connected to server
     Battle created! Room code: STUDY-XXXXXX
     ```

3. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Should show: `Auto-creating battle for deckId: [deckId]`
   - Should show: `✅ Connected to server`
   - Should NOT show CORS errors

### Step 3: Test 2-Player Battle

1. **Open Two Browser Windows**

   - Window 1: Login as User A
   - Window 2: Login as User B (or private browsing)

2. **Create Battle in Window 1**

   - Dashboard → Click Battle on any deck
   - Wait for room creation
   - Copy the room code (e.g., STUDY-ABC123)

3. **Join Battle in Window 2**

   - Open URL: `http://localhost:3000/battle-arena?room=STUDY-ABC123`
   - Replace STUDY-ABC123 with the actual room code
   - You should see both players in the lobby

4. **Start Battle**
   - Click "Start Battle" button (host only)
   - Both players should see countdown: 3 → 2 → 1 → GO!
   - Both should receive the same question

### Step 4: Monitor Server Logs

Watch your server terminal for messages like:

```
👤 User connected: [socketID]
✅ Player joined room STUDY-ABC123
🎮 Battle started in room STUDY-ABC123
✅ Question delivered to room STUDY-ABC123
✅ Answer received from player
🏆 Battle finished - Winner: [playerName]
```

## What Changed in the Code

### client/src/pages/BattleArena.js

**Before:** Component stuck on 'joining' state

```javascript
// No auto-creation of room
useEffect(() => { ... }, [roomCode, navigate]);
```

**After:** Auto-creates room when deckId is provided

```javascript
// Define createBattle first
const createBattle = async (deckId, settings) => { ... };

// Then call it in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  if (connected && socket && deckId && !roomCode && battleState === 'joining' && currentUser) {
    createBattle(deckId, { ... });
  }
}, [connected, socket, deckId, roomCode, battleState, currentUser]);
```

---

## Expected Flow

```
1. Click "🎮 Battle" on Dashboard
   ↓
2. URL: /battle-arena?deck={deckId}
   ↓
3. Socket connects to server
   ↓
4. Auto-creates battle room (POST to /api/battles/create)
   ↓
5. Joins room via Socket.io (emit 'join-room')
   ↓
6. Shows Lobby screen with room code
   ↓
7. Share room code or URL with other player
   ↓
8. Other player joins room
   ↓
9. Host clicks "Start Battle"
   ↓
10. Countdown: 3 → 2 → 1 → GO!
    ↓
11. Questions displayed in real-time
    ↓
12. Both players answer (or time runs out)
    ↓
13. Scores updated live
    ↓
14. Battle finishes → Results screen
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Shows "Waiting for room connection..."

1. **Check console for errors:**

   - F12 → Console tab
   - Look for red errors

2. **Verify server is running:**

   - Backend terminal should show: `🔌 WebSocket: ws://localhost:5000`

3. **Check network tab:**
   - F12 → Network tab
   - Look for `/socket.io` requests
   - Should be status 200 or 101 (WebSocket upgrade)

### Room creation fails

1. **Check MongoDB connection:**

   - Server should show: `✅ Connected to MongoDB`

2. **Check deckId is valid:**

   - URL should have: `?deck=5f7a1d8c9b2e3f4a5b6c7d8e`
   - Deck should exist in your MongoDB

3. **Check API response:**
   - Network tab → XHR → `/api/battles/create`
   - Should return 200 with roomCode and battleId

### CORS still appears

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R
2. **Clear cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete
3. **Restart servers:** Kill both npm processes and restart

## Expected Console Output

**Backend (server terminal):**

```
👤 User connected: abc123def456
🔌 WebSocket: ws://localhost:5000
✅ Connected to MongoDB
Socket.io EventHandlers: battleSocket loaded successfully
```

**Frontend (when creating battle):**

```
✅ Connected to server
Auto-creating battle for deckId: [ID]
Battle created! Room code: STUDY-XXXXXX
```

**Browser console (F12):**

```
✅ Connected to server
Socket.io connected successfully
Room created: STUDY-XXXXXX
```
