git push origin main
# Amplify will auto-deploy reverted version
# ~5 min to go live
```

### Option 2: Revert Infrastructure (if needed)
```bash
ssh -i <key> ec2-user@98.80.12.149
# Restore previous Nginx config from backup
sudo cp /etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf.backup /etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Option 3: Restart All Services
```bash
ssh -i <key> ec2-user@98.80.12.149
sudo systemctl restart nginx
pm2 restart study-buddy
