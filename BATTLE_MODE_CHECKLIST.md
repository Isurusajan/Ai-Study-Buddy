## 🎓 Learning Resources

If you want to understand the code better:

1. **Socket.io Documentation**

   - Official: socket.io/docs
   - Real-time communication guide

2. **ELO Rating System**

   - Chess.com explanation
   - Glicko rating system alternative

3. **React Hooks**

   - useState for state management
   - useEffect for side effects
   - useNavigate for routing

4. **MongoDB**
   - Schema design
   - Indexing for performance
   - Aggregation pipeline

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check Server Console**

   - Any error messages?
   - Is server running on 5000?
   - Can you see log messages?

2. **Check Browser Console**

   - Network tab for API errors
   - Console for JS errors
   - Application tab for localStorage

3. **Check Network**

   - Socket.io connection established?
   - WebSocket fallback working?
   - Latency acceptable?

4. **Check Database**

   - Connect to MongoDB
   - Verify collections created
   - Check document structure

5. **Check Environment**
   - All .env variables set?
   - GEMINI_API_KEY valid?
   - CLIENT_URL matches frontend?

---

## 📞 FAQ

**Q: Why are questions failing to generate?**
A: Most likely GEMINI_API_KEY is invalid or Gemini API quota exceeded. Check your API key and quota at console.cloud.google.com

**Q: Can I customize the timer duration?**
A: Yes, edit the `timePerQuestion` in `createBattleRoom` controller. Default is 15 seconds.

**Q: How many players can battle at once?**
A: Currently 2-8 by design. Can increase maxPlayers limit in settings.

**Q: Can I add more power-ups?**
A: Yes, add new power-up types in `battleSocket.js` `use-powerup` handler.

**Q: How do I increase ELO gain?**
A: Change K-factor in `eloService.js`. Higher K = more volatile ratings.

**Q: Can I delete battle history?**
A: Add DELETE endpoint in battleController.js if needed.
