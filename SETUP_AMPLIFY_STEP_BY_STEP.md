## Phase 1: Setup Backend on EC2 (20-30 minutes)

### Step 1: Create AWS Account

1. Go to [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
2. Click **"Create a free account"**
3. Enter email, password, set account name
4. Add payment method (won't charge if you stay in free tier)
5. Verify phone number
6. Choose **"Free plan"** support option
7. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for account activation

---

### Step 2: Create EC2 Instance

1. Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Search for **"EC2"** â†’ Click **"EC2 Dashboard"**
3. Click **"Launch Instance"**

**Configure Instance:**

- **Name**: `ai-study-buddy-backend`
- **AMI (Operating System)**: Select **"Amazon Linux 2 AMI"** (free tier eligible)
- **Instance Type**: Select **"t3.micro"** (free tier eligible)
- **Key Pair**:
  - Click **"Create new key pair"**
  - Name: `ai-study-buddy-key`
  - Type: **RSA**
  - Format: **.pem**
  - Click **"Create key pair"** (downloads automatically)
  - **SAVE THIS FILE SAFELY** - you'll need it to connect!

**Network Settings:**

- Click **"Edit"**
- **VPC**: Default VPC
- **Subnet**: Default subnet
- **Auto-assign public IP**: Enable âœ…
- **Firewall (Security Group)**:
  - Create security group: `ai-study-buddy-sg`
  - **Inbound Rules** (click "Add rule" for each):
    ```
    Rule 1: SSH | TCP | Port 22 | 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
    Rule 2: HTTP | TCP | Port 80 | 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
    Rule 3: HTTPS | TCP | Port 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
    Rule 4: Custom TCP | TCP | Port 5000 | 0.0.0.0/0 (your backend)
    ```

**Storage:**

- Size: 30 GB (free tier includes 30GB)
- Leave other settings default

**Click "Launch Instance"** âœ…

**Wait 2-3 minutes** for instance to start. You'll see "Instance State: Running" âœ…

---

### Step 3: Get Your EC2 Public IP

1. Go to EC2 Dashboard â†’ **"Instances"**
2. Click your instance: `ai-study-buddy-backend`
3. Copy **"Public IPv4 address"** (e.g., `54.123.45.67`)
4. **Save this IP** - you'll need it for Amplify setup

---

### Step 4: Connect to EC2 via SSH

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Navigate to where you saved the key
cd "C:\Users\ACER\Downloads"  # Adjust path to where key is

# Change permissions
icacls ai-study-buddy-key.pem /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(F)"

# Connect to EC2
ssh -i ai-study-buddy-key.pem ec2-user@54.123.45.67
# Replace 54.123.45.67 with your actual public IP

# Type "yes" when prompted "Are you sure you want to continue?"
```

**On Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads  # Or wherever you saved the key
chmod 600 ai-study-buddy-key.pem
ssh -i ai-study-buddy-key.pem ec2-user@54.123.45.67
```

**You should see:**

```
[ec2-user@ip-xxx ~]$
```

Great! You're now connected to your EC2 instance! âœ…

---

### Step 5: Install Node.js on EC2

Run these commands **one at a time** on your EC2 instance:

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo yum update -y

# Install Node.js 18
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version  # Should show v18.x.x
npm --version   # Should show v9.x.x or higher

# Install PM2 (process manager - keeps app running)
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Install Git
sudo yum install -y git

# Verify
git --version   # Should show git version
```

âœ… All development tools installed!

---

### Step 6: Clone Your Repository on EC2

```bash
# Create app directory
mkdir -p ~/ai-study-buddy
cd ~/ai-study-buddy

# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/Isurusajan/Ai-Study-Buddy.git .

# Verify
ls -la
# Should see: client/ server/ README.md etc.
```

---

### Step 7: Create Environment Files on EC2

**Create server/.env file:**

```bash
cd ~/ai-study-buddy/server

cat > .env << 'EOF'
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-amplify-domain.amplifyapp.com
EOF
```

**Instructions:**

1. **MONGODB_URI**:

   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - If not already done: Create account â†’ Create free cluster
   - Go to **"Databases"** â†’ Click your cluster
   - Click **"Connect"** â†’ Copy connection string
   - Paste into .env
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password
   - Example: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ai-study-buddy?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

2. **CLOUDINARY_NAME, API_KEY, API_SECRET**:

   - Go to [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
   - Copy your **"Cloud Name"** â†’ paste in CLOUDINARY_NAME
   - Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
   - Copy **"API Key"** â†’ paste in CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   - Copy **"API Secret"** â†’ paste in CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

3. **JWT_SECRET**:

   - Generate random string (use any random text, e.g., `your-super-secret-key-12345`)
   - **Make it strong and random!**

4. **CORS_ORIGIN**:
   - Leave as-is for now: `https://your-amplify-domain.amplifyapp.com`
   - We'll update it after Amplify deployment

**Save the file:**

```bash
# View to verify
cat .env

# Make sure all values are filled!
```

---

### Step 8: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/ai-study-buddy/server

# Install production dependencies
npm install --production

# This may take 2-3 minutes
# You should see "added XXX packages"
```

---

### Step 9: Start Backend with PM2

```bash
# Start backend
pm2 start "npm start" --name "backend"

# Save PM2 process list
pm2 save

# Make it start on system reboot
pm2 startup
# Copy the command it shows you and run it
# Should look like: sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin pm2 startup systemd -u ec2-user --hp /home/ec2-user

# Then run the command it showed
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin pm2 startup systemd -u ec2-user --hp /home/ec2-user

# View running processes
pm2 status
# Should show: backend | running

# View logs
pm2 logs backend
# Press Ctrl+C to exit logs
```

âœ… **Backend is now running and will auto-start on EC2 reboot!**

---

### Step 10: Test Backend is Working

**On your local machine** (not on EC2), open PowerShell:

```powershell
# Replace 54.123.45.67 with your EC2 public IP
curl -X GET http://54.123.45.67:5000/api/health -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"}

# Or simpler:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://54.123.45.67:5000/api/health" -Method Get
```

You should see a response (if your backend has a health endpoint).

**Or test login:**

```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "password123"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://54.123.45.67:5000/api/auth/login" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

âœ… **Backend is responding!**

---

## Phase 2: Setup AWS Amplify for Frontend (15-20 minutes)

### Step 1: Connect GitHub to Amplify

1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
2. Click **"Get Started"** â†’ **"Amplify Hosting"**
3. Select **"GitHub"** â†’ Click **"Continue"**
4. Click **"Authorize AWS Amplify on GitHub"**
5. GitHub will ask for permissions â†’ Click **"Authorize aws-amplify"**
6. Select your repository: `Isurusajan/Ai-Study-Buddy`
7. Select branch: **`main`**
8. Click **"Next"**

---

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

**On the build settings screen**, replace the entire YAML with:

```yaml
version: 1

frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - cd client
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Building React app..."
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: client/build
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - client/node_modules/**/*

backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Backend running on EC2"
```

---

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

1. Click **"Edit"** next to "Environment variables"
2. Add this variable:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://54.123.45.67:5000
```

**Replace `54.123.45.67`** with your actual EC2 public IP!

3. Click **"Save"**

---

### Step 4: Review & Deploy

1. Review all settings
2. Click **"Save and deploy"**
3. Amplify will start building!

**Watch the build progress:**

- The console shows real-time output
- First deployment takes 5-10 minutes
- You'll see: "âœ… Deployment successful"

When done, you'll get a URL like:

```
https://main.dxxxxx.amplifyapp.com
```

âœ… **Your frontend is now live!**

---

### Step 5: Update EC2 CORS Settings

Now that you have your Amplify domain, update your backend:

**On EC2**, update the .env file:

```bash
cd ~/ai-study-buddy/server

# Edit the file
nano .env

# Find CORS_ORIGIN line and change it to:
CORS_ORIGIN=https://main.dxxxxx.amplifyapp.com
# (Use your actual Amplify URL from Step 4)

# Save: Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter
```

**Restart backend:**

```bash
pm2 restart backend
pm2 logs backend
```

âœ… **CORS is now configured!**

---

## Phase 3: Test Everything (10-15 minutes)

### Test 1: Frontend is Live

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `https://main.dxxxxx.amplifyapp.com`
3. You should see your AI Study Buddy app!

---

### Test 2: Backend Connection

1. On the frontend, click **"Login"**
2. Try logging in with test credentials
3. **If it works**: Frontend â†” Backend connection is working! âœ…
4. **If it fails**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for errors
   - Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Amplify env variables

---

### Test 3: Create Battle

1. Login successfully
2. Create a battle
3. Check battle is created (visit MongoDB Atlas dashboard)

---

### Test 4: Upload PDF

1. Go to dashboard
2. Upload a PDF
3. Verify it appears in Cloudinary dashboard

---

## Phase 4: Setup Auto-Deployment (5 minutes)

**You're done!** Every time you push to GitHub:

```bash
# On your local machine
git add .
git commit -m "Fix battle settings"
git push origin main
```

**Amplify automatically:**

1. Detects the push
2. Builds your React app
3. Deploys to CDN
4. Your changes are live in 3-5 minutes!
