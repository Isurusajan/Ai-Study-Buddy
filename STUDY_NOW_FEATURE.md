## 📊 Rating System Explained

When you rate a flashcard, here's what happens:

| Button | Quality | What It Means | Next Review |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| ❌ Didn't Know | 1 | Complete failure | Tomorrow (interval resets) |
| 🤔 Somewhat | 3 | Correct with difficulty | ~6 days |
| 👍 Good | 4 | Correct with some effort | ~2 weeks |
| ✅ Perfect | 5 | Perfect recall | ~1 month+ |

The backend uses the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm** to calculate optimal review times.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Frontend (React)
- Uses React Router's `useParams` to get deck ID from URL
- Fetches deck info and flashcards on mount
- Tracks current card index and session statistics
- Sends review quality to backend after each card

### Backend Integration
- **GET /api/decks/:id** - Fetches deck information
- **GET /api/flashcards/decks/:deckId** - Fetches all flashcards
- **PUT /api/flashcards/:id/review** - Submits review quality

### State Management
```javascript
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);      // Which card you're on
const [showAnswer, setShowAnswer] = useState(false);      // Answer visible?
const [sessionStats, setSessionStats] = useState({        // Your performance
  correct: 0,
  incorrect: 0,
  total: 0
});
```
