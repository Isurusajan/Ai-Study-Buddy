## Troubleshooting

### If Mobile Design Looks Old
**Solution**: Hard refresh your browser
- Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Mac: `Cmd+Shift+R`
- This clears the cache and loads newest version

### If WebSocket Connection Fails
**Solution**: Check browser console
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Look for WebSocket connection attempt
4. Should see upgrade to `wss://`
5. If not, try refreshing page

### If Study Time Not Updating
**Solution**: Check localStorage
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click localStorage
4. Look for 'loginTime' entry
5. Should be timestamp of when you logged in
