## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Current Implementation

- ✅ Sub-100ms message delivery
- ✅ In-memory room storage (O(1) access)
- ✅ WebSocket + polling fallback
- ✅ 2-8 concurrent players per room
- ✅ Multiple concurrent rooms support

### Scalability Notes

## 📞 Support & Debugging

### Common Issues & Fixes

1. **WebSocket won't connect**

   - Check server running
   - Verify CLIENT_URL in .env
   - Check firewall

2. **Questions don't generate**

   - Verify GEMINI_API_KEY valid
   - Check deck has content
   - Monitor Gemini API quota

3. **Players can't see each other**

   - Check Socket.io in DevTools
   - Verify room code correct
   - Check console for errors

4. **Battle freezes mid-game**
   - Likely JS error in browser console
   - Check server logs
   - Try clearing cache
